   	  <h2>About</h2>
   	    <p> Cakery Makery Company was founded by Ayat Abu Karaki, a sweets devotee with a desire to create beautiful desserts that  taste as good as they look. 
        Ayat Abu Karaki began baking in 2015, creating desserts and cakes for family and friends. After teaching herself the basics, she decided to  collect the cakes recipes, to provide it for everyone who wants to learn how to make a cake in home.
        She discovered that she feel challenged by trying to make a cake from scratch, like making pastry dough instead of buying, she really enjoy making cakes and her passion is to be a pastry cheif and make her own recipes.
        Hope you will enjoy these recipes as much as she do.
