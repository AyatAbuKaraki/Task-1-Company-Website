      <h2>Classic Pound Cake</h2>
      <p>by browneyedbaker<br><br>
      Ingredients:<br>
 1   cup unsalted butter (chilled)<br>
 3   eggs(at room temperature)<br>
 3   egg yolks (at room temperature)<br>
 2   teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
 ½   teaspoon salt<br>
 1¼  cups granulated sugar<br>
 1¾  cups cake flour<br>
</p></div>

      <div class="recipep1">
        
        Directions:<br><br>
        1. Cut butter into 16 pieces and place in the bowl of an electric mixer; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to soften slightly. In a small bowl, use a fork to beat together the eggs, yolks and vanilla extract. Let stand at room temperature until ready to use.<br><br>
        2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan.<br><br>
         3. Beat the butter and salt at medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape the bowl once. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and gradually pour in the sugar. Once all of the sugar is added, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, 5 to 8 minutes, scraping the bowl once. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream. Scrape down the bowl, then beat the mixture at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the bowl.<br><br>
         4. Sift the flour over the batter in 3 additions, folding gently with a rubber spatula after each addition.<br><br>
         5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Let cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely, at least 2 hours, before serving. The cake can be stored, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, at room temperature for up to 3 days.<br>

      <h2>Caramel Carrot Cake</h2> 
      <p>By Home Cooking Adventure <br><br>
       Ingredients:<br>
*Carrot Cake Batter*<br>
2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour<br>
1 1/2 tsp (6g) baking powder<br>
1 1/2 tsp (9g) baking soda<br>
1 tsp (5g) salt<br>
2 tsp (6g) cinnamon<br>
1/2 tsp (2g) nutmeg<br>
4 eggs<br>
1 cup (200g) brown sugar<br>
1/2 cup (100g) sugar<br>
1 1/4 cups (275g) vegetable/canola oil<br>
12 oz (350g) finely grated carrot (about 4-5 medium carrots)<br>
1 cup pecans, toasted and chopped<br>

*Caramel Sauce*<br>
1 cup (200g) sugar<br>
1/4 cup (60ml) water<br>
1/2 cup (120g) whipping cream<br>
2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter, room temperature<br>
1 tsp (5g) vanilla extract<br>
1 tsp (5g) salt<br>

*Cream Cheese Frosting*<br>
17 oz (500g) cream cheese, room temperature<br>
1 1/4 cup (300g) whipping cream, 35%fat, chilled<br>
1/2 cup (60g) powdered sugar<br>
1/3 cup (80g) caramel sauce<br>
*For Decoration*<br>
remaining caramel sauce (160g)<br>
pecans<br>

</p></div>
    
    <div class="recipep2">

     <p> Directions: <br><br>

       1. Prepare the carrot cake layers. Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Grease and line with parchment paper two  9 inch (23 cm) round cake pans.<br><br>
2.  In a medium bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Set aside.<br><br>
3.  In a large bowl add eggs with both sugar and mix for few minutes until creamy and lighter in color. Add oil and mix until well combined. Gradually mix in flour mixture. Using a spatula incorporate the grated carrot and toasted pecans.<br><br>
4.  Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.<br><br>
5.  Bake for about 30-35 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.<br><br>
6.  Let pans cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes.<br><br>
7.  Remove the cakes from the pan and let them cool completely.<br><br>
8.  Prepare the caramel sauce.  Place the sugar and water in a medium heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, and cook without stirring until sugar dissolves and gets a caramel color.<br><br>
9.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the cream. It will bubble a little bit.<br><br>
10. Cook for about 1 minute stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until smooth.<br><br>
11. Remove from heat and add butter and salt. Stir well until smooth. Pour into a small jar and set aside to cool until the cake is ready.<br><br>
12. Prepare the frosting.  In a bowl beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add powdered sugar and 1/3 cup (80g) of caramel sauce.<br><br>
13. In another bowl whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold into the cream cheese mixture until well combined.<br><br>
14. Assemble the cake. Place one cake layer on your serving plate. Spread evenly with a bit less than half of frosting. Add the second layer of cake. Gradually spread the remaining frosting on top and sides of the cake.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.<br><br>
15. Before serving top the cake with remaining caramel sauce letting some to drip down the sides. If the caramel hardened too much heat it a bit over bain-marie to get to a pouring consistency. Decorate with chopped and whole pecans if desired.<br><br>
16. The leftover frosted cake can be covered and refrigerated for up to a week. Serve at room temperature.<br>

      <h2>Red Velvet Cake </h2>
      <p>By sallysbakingaddiction <br><br>
      Ingredients:<br>
3 cups (345g) cake flour (spoon & leveled)<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature<br>
2 cups (400g) granulated sugar<br>
1 cup (240ml) canola or vegetable oil<br>
4 large eggs, room temperature and separated<br>
1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br>
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar liquid or gel red food coloring<br>
1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature Cream Cheese Frosting<br>
16 ounces (450g) full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature<br>
1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature<br>
4 and 1/2 cups (540g) confectioners’ sugar<br>
1 Tablespoon (15ml) heavy cream or milk<br>
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract pinch of salt, to taste<br>

</p>
</div>
     
   <div class="recipep3">
     <p>
     	Directions: <br><br>

        1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper.  <br><br>
        2. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.<br><br>
        3. Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.<br><br>
         4. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.<br><br>
         5. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick.<br><br>
        6. Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.<br><br>
        7. Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar, cream/milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.<br><br>
        8. Assemble and frost: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. I used Wilton piping tip #12 for decoration around the top.<br><br>
         9.Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.<br><br>
        10. Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.<br>

     <p>
     	Directions: <br><br>

        1. Spray each ramekin with nonstick cooking spray and dust with cocoa powder. This ensures the cakes will seamlessly come out of the ramekins when inverted onto a plate in step 7. *Or spray half of a 12-count muffin pan and dust with cocoa powder. If baking in a muffin pan, the recipe will yield 6 cakes. <br><br>
        2. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). <br><br>
        3. Coarsely chop the chocolate. Place butter into a medium heat-proof bowl, then add chopped chocolate on top. Microwave on high in 10 second increments, stirring after each until completely smooth. Set aside. <br><br>
        4. Whisk the flour, confectioners’ sugar, and salt together in a small bowl. Whisk the eggs and egg yolks together until combined in another small bowl. Pour the flour mixture and eggs into the bowl of chocolate. Slowly stir everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. If there are any lumps, gently use your whisk to rid them. The batter will be slightly thick. <br><br>
       5. Spoon chocolate batter evenly into each prepared ramekin or muffin cup. <br><br>
       6. Place ramekins onto a baking sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes until the sides appear solid and firm– the tops will still look soft. *If baking in a muffin pan, the cakes only take about 8-10 minutes. <br><br>
        7. Allow to cool for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted plate and turn over. Use an oven mitt because those ramekins are hot! The cakes should release easily from the ramekin. *If you used a muffin pan, use a spoon to release the cakes from the pan and place each upside down on plates. <br><br>
         8. Add toppings. Serve immediately. <br>

       <h2>Blackberry Lime Cake</h2>
      <p>By Author:Carrie Sellman <br><br>
       Ingredients:<br>
*For the Blackberry Lime Cake:<br>
3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled<br>
1 tablespoon baking powder<br>
½ teaspoon baking soda<br>
½ teaspoon salt<br>
2 tablespoons organic lime zest<br>
¾ cup whole milk<br>
¼ cup lime juice<br>
8 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature<br>
2 cups granulated sugar<br>
4 eggs, room temperature<br>
2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
*For the Blackberry Reduction:<br>
12 ounces fresh blackberries<br>
1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br>
1 tablespoon lime juice<br>
*For the Blackberry Buttercream:<br>
6 egg whites<br>
1 ½ cups granulated sugar<br>
1 ½ cups unsalted butter, softened<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
3 tablespoons blackberry reduction<br>
*For the Assembly:<br>
12 ounces fresh blackberries<br>
edible flowers (micro pepper, alyssum and micro mint) washed and dried<br>

</p>
</div>
     
   <div class="recipep7">
     <p>
     	Directions: <br><br>

        *Make the Blackberry Lime Cake:<br><br>
         1. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and lightly flour three 8″ round pans. Line with parchment paper circles.<br><br>
           2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Zest limes and whisk into flour. Set aside.<br><br>
           3. In a small bowl, combine milk and lime juice.  Stir to combine and set aside for milk to curdle.  This is similar to making homemade buttermilk.<br><br>
           4. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter and sugar on medium-high using the paddle attachment.  Beat until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.<br><br>
           5. With the mixer on low, add eggs one at a time.  Mix well after each egg.<br><br>
            6. Add vanilla extract and mix to combine.<br><br>
            7. Add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.  Do not over mix.  Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl and the mixer blade.<br><br>
             8. Divide batter evenly between the three 8″ round pans.<br><br>
             9. Bake for 25-27 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.<br><br>
              10. Let cool in pans for 5 to 10 minutes, then remove to wire rack to finish cooling.<br><br>
            *Make the Blackberry Reduction:<br><br>
              1. Combine blackberries, sugar and lime juice in a pan over medium heat.<br><br>
              2. Cook 10 to 15 minutes until the juices are bubbly and the berries are soft enough to smash with the back of a spoon.<br><br>
              3. Press the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl to remove the seeds. Use the back of your wooden spoon to really press as much pulp through as you can. Scrape the underside of the strainer to get all of the accumulated blackberry pulp. Discard seeds and return strained puree back to the pan.<br><br>
              4. Cook on medium, stirring with a wooden spoon, until reduced to only a few tablespoons, about 10 minutes.
               5. Pour into a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pushing the plastic down to touch the blackberry reduction so that a skin does not form. Allow to cool.<br><br>
              *Make the Blackberry Buttercream:<br><br>
               1. Place egg whites and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk until combined.<br><br>
                2. Place bowl over a pan of simmering water to create a double-boiler. Whisking constantly, heat the egg mixture until it registers 160 degrees on a candy thermometer. Carefully transfer the bowl onto the stand mixer.<br><br>
                 3. Using the whisk attachment, beat the egg white mixture on high speed for 8 to 10 minutes until the bowl is no longer warm to the touch and the meringue is fluffy, glossy and holds a stiff peak.<br><br>
                  4. Switch to the paddle attachment. With the mixer on low, slowly add cubed butter and mix until incorporated.<br><br>
                   5. Add vanilla extract and whip on medium-high until silky and smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.<br><br>
                    6. Add blackberry reduction and whip again until incorporated. The buttercream may look like it’s broken at some point. Keep mixing until it is completely smooth.<br><br>
                  *Assemble the Cake:<br><br>
                    1. Place one layer of cake onto serving plate or cake stand and top with about one cup of blackberry frosting.<br><br>
                     2. Repeat with second cake layer, more frosting and then last layer of cake.  Crumb coat and frost cake with remaining frosting.<br><br>
                     3. Decorate with additional blackberries and edible flowers. Start by laying out blackberries in a crescent shape, spacing them close together but not touching. Tuck in small sprigs of the micro mint here and there, but not everywhere. Next, add the alyssum, using only the top blooming section of each sprig. Add a few extra berries for height if needed. Fill remaining small holes with the micro pepper blooms.<br><br>
                      4. Reserve extra berries and blooms to adorn individual slices when serving, if desired.<br>

   <div class="recipep8">
     <p>
     	Directions: <br><br>

       1. Prepare pistachio cake. Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Grease a 8 ½ inch (21cm) pan and line with parchment paper.<br><br>
       2. In a large bowl add eggs and sugar. Mix to combine. Mix for about 10 minutes until thick and tripled in volume.<br><br>
        3. Gradually fold in ground pistachio, flour and in the end incorporate melted butter.<br><br>
         4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 15-17 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.<br><br>
          5. Remove from oven, let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.<br><br>
          6. Prepare raspberry sauce so it has time to cool before preparing the raspberry mousse. Place raspberries, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan and place over medium heat, bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and sieve to remove seeds. Set aside while you prepare the gelatin.<br><br>
          7. Dissolve gelatin in 2 tbsp cold water and let it swell for about 5 to 10 minutes. Add the gelatine over the warm raspberry sauce and stir to dissolve. Let the raspberry mixture cool at room temperature while you prepare the rest.
          8. Prepare white chocolate pistachio layer. Place chocolate and cream into a small heatproof bowl and melt over bain-marie. When melted remove from heat and add chopped pistachio.<br><br>
          9. Use a 8 inch (20cm) cake ring to cut the edges of the cake.<br><br>
          10. Line the cake ring with acetate sheet and place the ring on the serving platter. Add the pistachio cake. Spread chocolate pistachio over the cake and set aside or refrigerate until you prepare the mousse.<br><br>
          11. Prepare raspberry mousse.  Whip the chilled whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Add the cooled raspberry mixture and mix until well combined. Pour over the set white chocolate layer over the cake. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br><br>
           12. Prepare mango mousse. Peel mango and cut into slices. Blend using a vertical blender until puree. Add sugar and mix to combine.<br><br>
          13. Dissolve gelatin in 2 tbsp cold water and let it swell for about 5 to 10 minutes. Place over low heat just until the gelatin dissolves and then pour it over mango puree.<br><br>
           14. Whip the chilled whipping cream until soft peaks form. Add the mango mixture and mix until well combined. Pour over the raspberry mousse.<br><br>
            15. Refrigerate for about 4 hrs or overnight to set.<br><br>
             16. Prepare raspberry jelly.  Place raspberries and sugar in a small saucepan and place over medium heat, bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and sieve to remove seeds. Set aside while you prepare the gelatin.<br><br>
            17. Dissolve gelatin in 1 tbsp cold water and let it swell for about 5 minutes. Add the gelatine over the warm raspberry sauce and stir to dissolve. Let the raspberry mixture cool at room temperature and poor over the mango mousse.<br><br>
            18. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours to set before serving.<br>

</p>
</div>
     
   <div class="recipep9">
     <p>
     	Directions: <br><br>

        1. Prepare the strawberry jelly. In a small bowl place the gelatin and cold water and let swell for 5-10 minutes.<br><br>
        2. Meanwhile in a small saucepan place the strawberries and sugar and place over medium-low heat. Bring to a simmer, cook for about 5 minutes and remove from heat. Blend the mixture to make a smooth sauce. Pass through a strainer to remove the seeds.<br><br>
        3. Dissolve gelatin over very low heat and mix with the strawberry puree.<br><br>
         4. Line a 8 inch (20 cm) round pan with plastic wrap.<br><br>
          5. Pour the strawberry puree into the pan and freeze for at least 4 hours or even overnight. Cover with plastic wrap after the first hour.<br><br>
           6. Prepare the chocolate cake. Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Grease and line with parchment paper a 8 inch (20 cm) round cake pan.<br><br>
           7. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt.<br><br>
           8. In another bowl mix sugar with egg and oil until combined. Mix in buttermilk and vanilla extract. Incorporate flour mixture until well combined. Add hot water and mix to combine. The batter will have a runny consistency.<br><br>
           9. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.<br><br>
           10. Bake for about 30 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with few crumbs attached.Let cool completely.<br><br>
           11. Prepare the white chocolate mousse.   In a heat proof bowl add the white chocolate and 2/3 cup (160g) whipping cream. Place the bowl over a saucepan with simmering water, over low heat until all the chocolate is melted. Meanwhile dissolve gelatin in cold water and let it swell for about 5 to 10 minutes. Place the gelatin over low heat just until the gelatin dissolves and pour it over the melted chocolate mixture. Let the chocolate mixture cool completely at room temperature.<br><br>
           12. Whip the remaining 1 2/3 cup (400g) cold whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Add melted chocolate mixture and mix until well combined.<br><br>
            13. Assemble the cake. Line with parchment paper a 9 inch (23 cm) pan. You can use a springform pan or a cakeware pan like the one I have from Delicake.<br><br>
             14. Place the chocolate cake in the middle of the pan. Add half of the white chocolate mousse on top and fill the edges. Add the strawberry jelly in the middle, on top of the mousse. Add the remaining half of white chocolate mousse and spread evenly.Cover and place in the freezer overnight.<br><br>
             15. Prepare chocolate mirror glaze. In a small bowl place the gelatin and 1/4 cup (50ml) cold water and let swell for 5-10 minutes. Place the chocolate in a bowl and set aside.<br><br>
              16. Place water, sugar, condensed milk and cocoa powder in a saucepan. Bring it just to a boil and remove from heat. Stir in the bloomed gelatin until it is dissolved.<br><br>
              17. Pour the hot cocoa mixture over chocolate. Let sit for about 5 minutes until the chocolate is melted. Use an immersion blender and blend until smooth. Sieve the glaze and let it cool to 90-95F (32-35C) before pouring over the frozen cake.<br><br>
              18. Take the cake out of the freezer and use a hair dryer to defrost the edges. Remove the cake from the pan and place it over a rack or simply on a bowl placed over a parchment paper lined baking sheet to collect the excess.
              <br><br>
              19. Pour the glaze on top and edges of the cake. Use an offset spatula to remove the drips and decorate the bottom of the cake with grated chocolate. Transfer the cake to a serving platter and refrigerate for several hours to defrost the cake and set the glaze.<br><br>
              20. Before serving decorate the cake with fresh strawberries and white chocolate curls if desired.<br>
